abstract = {A major challenge in ecology is forecasting the effects of species' extinctions, a pressing problem given current human impacts on the planet. Consequences of species losses such as secondary extinctions are difficult to forecast because species are not isolated, but interact instead in a complex network of ecological relationships. Because of their mutual dependence, the loss of a single species can cascade in multiple coextinctions. Here we show that an algorithm adapted from the one Google uses to rank web-pages can order species according to their importance for coextinctions, providing the sequence of losses that results in the fastest collapse of the network. Moreover, we use the algorithm to bridge the gap between qualitative (who eats whom) and quantitative (at what rate) descriptions of food webs. We show that our simple algorithm finds the best possible solution for the problem of assigning importance from the perspective of secondary extinctions in all analyzed networks. Our approach relies on network structure, but applies regardless of the specific dynamical model of species' interactions, because it identifies the subset of coextinctions common to all possible models, those that will happen with certainty given the complete loss of prey of a given predator. Results show that previous measures of importance based on the concept of "hubs" or number of connections, as well as centrality measures, do not identify the most effective extinction sequence. The proposed algorithm provides a basis for further developments in the analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are major tools to protect biodiversity and sustain fisheries. For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of MPA networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between MPAs remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred MPAs. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean MPAs are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each MPA was directly connected to four others and MPAs were clustered into several groups. Two MPAs (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of MPA distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20{\%} of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected MPAs providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more.},

abstract = {Networks of nature reserves and protected areas are important instruments to protect biodiversity, including harvested populations. Selection of marine protected networks (MPA) will depend on both the connectivity of concerned species and the habitat quality of individual sites. We explore the relative effect of connectivity and habitat quality on solutions for optimal networks of MPA using eigenvalue perturbation theory and a metapopulation model. Based on analyses of both synthetic networks and realistic connectivities for a sessile invertebrate with planktonic larvae in the Baltic Sea, we show that connectivity is expected to be more efficient than habitat quality as a selection criterion for MPA networks with realistic probabilities of local recruitment. In a second series of analyses we explore the effect of temporal variability of connectivity on the selection of optimal MPA networks. We show that optimal solutions of MPA networks converged when based on 8–10 years of connectivity information, corresponding to the time scale of the North-Atlantic oscillation. In conclusion, this study indicates that connectivity may be more important than habitat quality as selection criterion for MPAs when targeting species with long-distance dispersal that is typical for many marine invertebrates and fish. Our study also shows that connectivity patterns may be relatively consistent in time which suggests that the recent progress in biophysical modelling can offer a framework for optimal selection of MPA networks based on connectivities, which should improve guidelines for the design of functional MPA networks.},

Although the tides change considerably between deep water and the continental shelf, the horizontal velocity gradients are not sufficient to explain the observed average current. One possible explanation, which displays the tendency to enhance the current over the shallow side of the slope, is a boundary current driven by a north-south pressure gradient, with pressure increasing towards the north. Such a pressure gradient could be a surface level gradient which contributes to a large term in the vorticity equation in regions with large bottom slopes.},

abstract = {The circulation of water masses in the northeastern North Atlantic Ocean has a strong influence on global climate owing to the northward transport of warm subtropical water to high latitudes. But the ocean circulation at depths below the reach of satellite observations is difficult to measure, and only recently have comprehensive, direct observations of whole ocean basins been possible. Here we present quantitative maps of the absolute velocities at two levels in the northeastern North Atlantic as obtained from acoustically tracked floats. We find that most of the mean flow transported northward by the Gulf Stream system at the thermocline level (about 600 m depth) remains within the subpolar region, and only relatively little enters the Rockall trough or the Nordic seas. Contrary to previous work, our data indicate that warm, saline water from the Mediterranean Sea reaches the high latitudes through a combination of narrow slope currents and mixing processes. At both depths under investigation, currents cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge preferentially over deep gaps in the ridge, demonstrating that sea-floor topography can constrain even upper-ocean circulation patterns.},

It remains elusive how these hotspots of biodiversity can thrive in such a food-limited environment, as data on energy flow and organic carbon utilization are critically lacking. Here we report in situ community respiration rates for cold-water coral and sponge ecosystems obtained by the non-invasive aquatic Eddy Correlation technique. Oxygen uptake rates over coral reefs and adjacent sponge grounds in the Tr{\ae}na Coral Field (Norway) were 9-20 times higher than those of the surrounding soft sediments. These high respiration rates indicate strong organic matter consumption, and hence suggest a local focusing onto these ecosystems of the downward flux of organic matter that is exported from the surface ocean. Overall, our results show that coral reefs and adjacent sponge grounds are hotspots of carbon processing in the food-limited deep ocean, and that these deep-sea ecosystems play a more prominent role in marine biogeochemical cycles than previously recognized.},

abstract = {Human-induced climate change is projected to increase ocean temperature and modify circulation patterns, with potential widespread implications for the transport and survival of planktonic larvae of marine organisms. Circulation affects the dispersal of larvae, whereas temperature impacts larval development and survival. However, the combined effect of changes in circulation and temperature on larval dispersal and survival has rarely been studied in a future climate scenario. Such understanding is crucial to predict future species distributions, anticipate ecosystem shifts and design effective management strategies. We simulate contemporary (1990s) and future (2060s) dispersal of lobster larvae using an eddy-resolving ocean model in south-eastern Australia, a region of rapid ocean warming. Here we show that the effects of changes in circulation and temperature can counter each other: ocean warming favours the survival of lobster larvae, whereas a strengthened western boundary current diminishes the supply of larvae to the coast by restricting cross-current larval dispersal. Furthermore, we find that changes in circulation have a stronger effect on connectivity patterns of lobster larvae along south-eastern Australia than ocean warming in the future climate so that the supply of larvae to the coast reduces by {\~{}}4{\%} and the settlement peak shifts poleward by {\~{}}270 km in the model simulation. Thus, ocean circulation may be one of the dominant factors contributing to climate-induced changes of species ranges.},

abstract = {This study, based on satellite-derived sea-surface heights and temperatures as well as hydrographic data, attempts to shed some light on the role of the extreme phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for the local dynamics of the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC). During the low-NAO event 2009-10 the Shetland-slope current showed a significant deflection from its usual path above the maximal gradient of the bathymetry, ultimately resulting in an anticyclone. This led to an accumulation of North Atlantic Water (NAW) over the deeper parts of the channel, manifested as a pronounced deepening of the halocline. Leading this deflection of the slope current by around 2 weeks, a cyclonic eddy associated with a doming of the halocline and originating from north of the Faroes (and hence constituted by Modified North Atlantic Waters) had moved southwards in the channel, coming to rest at its southern entrance. Assessing the influence of the NAO on these regional dynamics using 1992-2010 altimetric data, it was found that for positive phases of the NAO, the surface circulation tended to be strongly bathymetrically constrained and thus resembles the mean regional circulation. The negative phases of the NAO are associated with a regional weakening of the wind-stress curl, which leads to a contraction of the Norwegian-Sea gyre and a linked northward migration of the FSC recirculation involving a deflected path of the Shetland-slope current. This change in the circulation under negative NAO conditions may have an impact on the regional ocean climate through the accumulation of saline NAW in the channel.

For the first time, we present direct evidence of large-scale population connectivity within an existing and effective network of MPAs. A new parentage analysis identified four parent-offspring pairs from a large, exploited population of the coral-reef fish Zebrasoma flavescens in Hawai'i, revealing larval dispersal distances ranging from 15 to 184 km. In two cases, successful dispersal was from an MPA to unprotected sites. Given high adult abundances, the documentation of any parent-offspring pairs demonstrates that ecologically-relevant larval connectivity between reefs is substantial. All offspring settled at sites to the north of where they were spawned. Satellite altimetry and oceanographic models from relevant time periods indicated a cyclonic eddy that created prevailing northward currents between sites where parents and offspring were found. These findings empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MPAs as useful conservation and management tools and further highlight the importance of coupling oceanographic, genetic, and ecological data to predict, validate and quantify larval connectivity among marine populations.},

abstract = {The deep sea is the world's largest ecosystem, with high levels of biodiversity and many species that exhibit life-history characteristics that make them vulnerable to high levels of exploitation. Many fisheries in the deep sea have a track record of being unsustainable. In the northeast Atlantic, there has been a decline in the abundance of commercial fish species since deep-sea fishing commenced in the 1970s. Current management is by effort restrictions and total allowable catch (TAC), but there remain problems with compliance and high levels of bycatch of vulnerable species such as sharks. The European Union is currently considering new legislation to manage deep-sea fisheries, including the introduction of a depth limit to bottom trawling. However, there is little evidence to suggest an appropriate depth limit. Here we use survey data to show that biodiversity of the demersal fish community, the ratio of discarded to commercial biomass, and the ratio of Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) to commercial biomass significantly increases between 600 and 800 m depth while commercial value decreases. These results suggest that limiting bottom trawling to a maximum depth of 600 m could be an effective management strategy that would fit the needs of European legislations such as the Common Fisheries Policy (EC no. 1380/2013) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC).},

Most previous explanations identify the driver of the AMO as the ocean circulation, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here we show that the main features of the observed AMO are reproduced in models where the ocean heat transport is prescribed and thus cannot be the driver. Allowing the ocean circulation to interact with the atmosphere does not significantly alter the characteristics of the AMO in the current generation of climate models. These results suggest that the AMO is the response to stochastic forcing from the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, with thermal coupling playing a role in the tropics. In this view, the AMOC and other ocean circulation changes would be largely a response to, not a cause of, the AMO.},

@article{Cowen2009,
abstract = {Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with complex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they occupy hamper our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Evidence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range from fully open to fully closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed dispersal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differential postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental ecological processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.},

abstract = {Along the Atlantic European continental margin, living cold-water coral reefs occur over a wide bathymetric and hydrographical range. Focusing on 2 regions, the Celtic and the Norwegian shelves, we found that cold-water coral reefs are limited to different intermediate water masses. Measurements of the physical and geological properties showed that parameters such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen content, current intensities, and different substrates vary widely without specifically impacting the distribution of living cold-water coral reefs. The habitat of living reefs within the NE Atlantic comprises a temperature-salinity field, with its lower boundary equivalent to the Intermediate Salinity Maximum (ISM). The ISM on the Celtic margin is represented by Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), but is replaced by Atlantic Water (AW) on the Norwegian margin. The upper limit corresponds to water mass boundaries of Eastern North Atlantic Water/MOW on the Celtic margin and Norwegian Coastal Water/AW on the Norwegian margin. Our study shows that cold-water corals in the North Atlantic tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. However, our data indicate that living cold-water coral reefs occur within the density envelope of sigma-theta ($\sigma$$\Theta$) = 27.35 to 27.65 kg m–3, thus highlighting the importance of physical boundary conditions for cold-water coral growth and distribution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lophelia pertusa is a keystone cold-water coral species with a widespread distribution. Due to the lack of a mitochondrial marker variable enough for intraspecific analyses, the population structure of this species has only been studied using ITS and microsatellites so far. We therefore decided to sequence and compare complete mitochondrial genomes from two distant L. pertusa populations putatively isolated from each other (in the Barents Sea off Norway and in the Mediterranean Sea off Italy) in the hope of finding regions variable enough for population genetic and phylogeographic studies. RESULTS: The mitogenomes of two L. pertusa individuals collected in the Mediterranean and Barents seas differed at only one position, which was a non-synonymous substitution, but comparison with another recently published L. pertusa mitochondrial genome sequence from Norway revealed 18 nucleotide differences. These included two synonymous and nine non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes (dN/dS > 1): hence, the mitogenome of L. pertusa may be experiencing positive selection. To test for the presence of cryptic species, the mitochondrial control region and the nuclear ITS2 were sequenced for five individuals from each site: Italian and Norwegian populations turned out to share haplotypes of both markers, indicating that they belonged to the same species. CONCLUSIONS: L. pertusa corals collected 7,500 km apart shared identical nuclear ITS2 and near-identical mitogenomes, supporting the hypothesis of a recent connection between Lophelia reefs in the Mediterranean and in the Northern Atlantic. Multi-locus or population genomic approaches will be required to shed further light on the genetic connectivity between L. pertusa reefs across Europe; nevertheless, ITS2 and the mitochondrial control region may be useful markers for investigating the phylogeography and species boundaries of the keystone genus Lophelia across its worldwide area of distribution.},

abstract = {This study reports a newly established sub-population of Lophelia pertusa, the dominant reef-framework forming coral species in the north-east Atlantic, on oil and gas platforms in the northern North Sea. L. pertusa was positively identified on 13 of 14 platforms examined using existing oil and gas industry visual inspections. Two platforms were inspected in more detail to examine depth and colony size distributions. We recorded 947 colonies occurring between 59 and 132 m depth that coincides with cold Atlantic water at depths below the summer thermocline in the northern North Sea. We suggest that these colonies provide evidence for a planktonic larval stage of L. pertusa with recruits initially originating from populations in the north-east Atlantic and now self recruiting to the platforms. Size class distribution showed a continuous range of size classes, but with few outlying large colonies. The break between the largest colonies and the rest of the population is considered as the point when colonies began self recruiting to the platforms, resulting in greater colonization success. We present the first documented in situ colony growth rate estimate (26 +/- 5 mm yr(-1)) for L. pertusa based on 15 colonies from the Tern Alpha platform with evidence for yearly recruitment events starting the year the platform was installed. Evidence of contamination from drill muds and cuttings was observed on the Heather platform but appeared limited to regions close to drilling discharge points, where colonies experience partial as well as whole colony mortality.},

abstract = {Reconstructing historical variation of population size from sequence and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data is valuable for understanding the evolutionary history of species. Changes in the population size of humans have been thoroughly investigated, and we review different methodologies of demographic reconstruction, specifically focusing on human bottlenecks. In addition to the classical approaches based on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) or based on linkage disequilibrium, we also review more recent approaches that utilize atypical shared genomic fragments, such as identical by descent or homozygous segments between or within individuals. Compared with methods based on the SFS, these methods are well suited for detecting recent bottlenecks. In general, all these various methods suffer from bias and dependencies on confounding factors such as population structure or poor specification of the mutational and recombination processes, which can affect the demographic reconstruction. With the exception of SFS-based methods, the effects of confounding factors on the inference methods remain poorly investigated. We conclude that an important step when investigating population size changes rests on validating the demographic model by investigating to what extent the fitted demographic model can reproduce the main features of the polymorphism data.},

abstract = {AbstractThe ratio of warming to cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide has been shown to be approximately independent of time and emissions scenarios and directly relates emissions to temperature. It is therefore a potentially important tool for climate mitigation policy. The transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE), defined as the ratio of global-mean warming to cumulative emissions at CO2 doubling in a 1{\%} yr−1 CO2 increase experiment, ranges from 0.8 to 2.4 K EgC−1 in 15 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)—a somewhat broader range than that found in a previous generation of carbon–climate models. Using newly available simulations and a new observational temperature dataset to 2010, TCRE is estimated from observations by dividing an observationally constrained estimate of CO2-attributable warming by an estimate of cumulative carbon emissions to date, yielding an observationally constrained 5{\%}–95{\%} range of 0.7–2.0 K EgC−1.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to predict changes in the distribution and extent of habitat forming species defined as “Priority Marine Habitats” (PMHs) in the North-East (NE) Atlantic under future scenarios of climate-induced environmental change. A Species Distribution Modelling method was used for each PMH to map the potential distribution of “most suitable” habitat. The area and percentage cover was calculated within each country׳s Exclusive Economic Zone for the baseline (2009) and the projected (2100) years. In addition, a conservation management score was calculated based on the number of PMHs that co-occur in assessment units. Overall, this study reveals the potential for movement and/or change in the extent of some PMHs across the NE Atlantic under an increased ocean temperature scenario (4°C) by 2100. There are regional differences in the predicted changes and some countries will experience greater/different changes than others. The movement of biodiversity hotspots (where one or more PMHs occur in the same broad area) provides both opportunities and risks for conservation management that are discussed. Co-operation between neighbouring countries and marine regions will require substantial enhancement in order to provide a robust adaptive management strategy going forward.},

abstract = {This study examined the level of management complexity (simultaneously occurring licensed human activities) within the currently designated Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in Scottish waters and through modelling and statistical analysis determined which variables play an important role in defining the level of management effort required for each MPA. This study utilised surveyed distribution data for Priority Marine Features and modelled distribution data showing potential “Most Suitable” Priority Marine Feature habitat through the species distribution model, Maxent. Prediction indicators were developed through Spearman׳s Rank coefficients and a linear regression model. Results showed that, (1) there was a significant negative correlation between the management complexity score within 5km of a MPA and the number of casework events (defined as any work or statutory consultation associated with an MPA, such as planning applications, discharges or new fisheries); and (2) a significant positive correlation between the number of casework events and location, number of features, and the type of features and most suitable scores. Calculations showed that Lochs Duich, Long and Alsh, Loch Sunart, Loch Sween and Loch Creran may potentially require most effort to manage once they are designated as MPAs. This study showed that it is possible to evaluate options within an MPA network to achieve cost effective options for the biodiversity and socio-economic objectives of MPA networks and that some MPAs are likely to be more efficient than others in terms of management time.},

abstract = {The answer to the title question is uncertain, as very few manipulative experiments have been conducted to test how deep-sea scleractinians (stony corals) react to changes in seawater chemistry. Ocean pH and calciumcarbonate saturation are decreasing due to an influx of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere. Experimental evidence has shown that declining carbonate saturation inhibits the ability of marine organisms to build calcium carbonate skeletons, shells, and tests. Here we put forward a hypothesis suggesting that the global distribution of deep-sea scleractinian corals could be limited in part by the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon (ASH) in the world's oceans. Aragonite is the metastable form of calcium carbonate used by scleractinian corals to build their skeletons and the ASH is the limit between saturated and undersaturated water. The hypothesis is tested by reviewing the distribution of deep-sea, bioherm-forming scleractinian corals with respect to the depth of the ASH. Results indicate ...},

abstract = {Population connectivity refers to the exchange of individuals among populations: it affects gene flow, regulates population size and function, and mitigates recovery from natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Many populations in the deep sea are spatially fragmented, and will become more so with increasing resource exploitation. Understanding population connectivity is critical for spatial management. For most benthic species, connectivity is achieved by the planktonic larval stage, and larval dispersal is, in turn, regulated by complex interactions between biological and oceanographic processes. Coupled biophysical models, incorporating ocean circulation and biological traits, such as planktonic larval duration (PLD), have been used to estimate population connectivity and generate spatial management plans in coastal and shallow waters. In the deep sea, knowledge gaps in both the physical and biological components are delaying the effective use of this approach. Here, we review the current efforts in conservation in the deep sea and evaluate (1) the relevance of using larval dispersal in the design of marine protected areas and (2) the application of biophysical models in the study of population connectivity. Within biophysical models, PLD can be used to estimate dispersal distance. We propose that a PLD that guarantees a minimum dispersal distance for a wide range of species should be used in the planning of marine protected areas in the deep sea. Based on a review of data on species found at depths > 200 m, a PLD of 35 and 69 days ensures a minimum distance for 50{\%} and 75{\%}, respectively, of eurybathic and deep-sea species. We note that more data are required to enhance accuracy and address the high variability in PLD between and within taxonomic groups, limiting generalizations that are often appealing to decision-makers. Given the imminent expansion of resource exploitation in the deep sea, data relevant to spatial management are needed urgently.},

abstract = {We examine the trends and variability in temperature of the northwest European shelf seas over the period 1960–2004 using four approaches: a regional model simulation (using the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System; POLCOMS), in situ multi-annual timeseries observations, satellite remote sensed (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST), and an analysis of data held in an international database at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). We focus on variability for the full period and trends from 1985 to 2004, being limited by the length of model simulation and the availability of satellite data. We find that all data sources give a consistent picture, with both trends and variability being intensified on-shelf and north of ∼48°N. The model and AVHRR SST show statistically significant warming trends in large areas of this region that are clearly distinguishable from both model/observation error and natural variability on these timescales. This ‘signal to noise ratio’ is substantially reduced when near bottom temperatures are considered in the model. The long timeseries at Port Erin (Isle of Man) shows that the variation in trend is well represented by the model and that the warming trend in the period 1985–2004 is substantially larger and of longer duration than previous peaks in 20-year trends since 1914. We find that the SST trends are greater in the model and satellite observations than the air temperature trends in the ERA40 re-analysis used for forcing; the net sea to air heat flux is ∼20{\%} less in 1985–2004 than 1960–1984 (including shortwave, longwave, sensible and latent components). This is partly compensated by a ∼9{\%} reduction in advective warming. The model shows the trends in seasonally stratified regions are greater at the surface than at depth, indicating an increase in this stratification. While this pattern is also seen in the annual trends from the ICES data analysis, the lack of seasonal resolution hampers a quantitative corroboration. The model is seen to have good skill in reproducing both the trends and variability, but tends to underestimate the trends. The modelled variability is overestimated in some coastal and open ocean regions and underestimated elsewhere, while the phase of this variability is generally well represented. Generally the model performance is better on-shelf than in the open ocean.},

Questions of global change entail elucidation of the processes that determine the quantities, transformation and fate of materials transported between the shelf and ocean, the measurement and definition of exchange processes, and the development of prognostic models of exchanges. Physical processes control the large-scale movement and irreversible small-scale mixing of water and its constituents. At the shelf edge, steep bathymetry may inhibit ocean-shelf exchange, but in combination with stratification gives rise to special processes and modelling challenges. A preliminary assessment is made of coastal-trapped waves; along-slope currents, instability and meanders; eddies; upwelling, fronts and filaments; downwelling, cascading; tides, surges; internal tides and waves as potentially influential processes in ocean-shelf exchange, water-mass structure and general circulation, according to their scales and context. For this purpose, theory and previous measurements are interpreted. Future studies needed to improve this assessment are discussed.},

abstract = {Temperature, salinity and flow variability on the north-west European Shelf west of Scotland are examined. Analyses are derived from a range of marine and atmospheric data sources which together comprise a “proto-observatory” of the European Shelf to the west of the Scottish mainland. The main time series are from a current meter mooring which has been maintained on the northwest European continental shelf since June 1981, and a hydrographic section repeated at least annually across the shelf at {\~{}}56°N since 1975. With the exception of occasional episodes the water column at the mooring site is well mixed or weakly stratified throughout the year. The mean water temperature was 10.1 °C and the dominant mode of variance in the temperature record is the seasonal cycle (SA), with amplitude of 3.2 °C. The currents are constrained by a passage and are dominated by the semi-diurnal tidal species. There is also significant energy in SA in the along channel velocity but not in the across channel velocity. The along channel residual has mean value of 10.8 cm s−1 directed towards the north, a clear manifestation of the coastal current, with very few, short duration periods of flow reversal. The monthly temperature anomaly time series are compared with the NE Atlantic upper layer heat content anomalies. Both anomaly time series show highs in the late 1980s and 1990s and lows in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. The overall trend is of warming at a rate of +0.57 °C per decade, with the timing of maximum annual temperature receding by 12 days per decade through the time series. A simple barotropic dynamic balance for the along channel flow in the passage demonstrates that the near surface wind dominates the variability of the northward flow, and that both the north/south gradient in sea level slope and atmospheric pressure are significant in driving the coastal current northwards. This balance reveals a bias is previous summer-only estimates of the flow rate of the coastal current, and a revised figure approximately double that of previous estimates is suggested. Residual winter flows correlate significantly with the North Atlantic Oscillation index (r=0.59). In contradiction to previous published analyses, shelf salinities exhibit only weak seasonality. No single determining factor is found for the longitudinal excursion of surface isohalines across the shelf, however prolonged periods of high NAO index do coincide with a raised salinity of shelf waters.},

abstract = {Wyville Thomson Ridge Overflow Water (WTOW), which is the only part of the outflow from the Norwegian Sea not to directly enter the Iceland Basin, is shown to be a significant water mass in the northern Rockall Trough. It is found primarily at intermediate depths (600–1200m) beneath the northward flowing warm Atlantic waters, and above recirculating Mediterranean influenced waters and Labrador Sea Water (LSW). The bottom of the WTOW layer can be identified by a mid-depth inflexion point in potential temperature–salinity plots. An analysis of historical data reveals that WTOW has been present in all but eight of the last 31 years at 57.5°N in the Rockall Trough. A denser component of WTOW below 1500m has also been present, although it appears to be less persistent (12 out of the 31 years) and limited to the west of the section. The signature of intermediate WTOW was absent in two periods, the mid-1980s and early 1990s, both of which coincided with a freshening, and probable increase in volume, of LSW in the trough. Potential temperature–salinity diagrams from historical observations indicate that WTOW persists at least as far south as 55°N (and as far west as 20°W in the Iceland Basin) although its signature is quickly lost on leaving the Rockall Trough. We suggest that a transport of WTOW down the western side of the trough exists, with WTOW at intermediate depths entering the eastern trough either via a cyclonic recirculation, or as a result of eddy activity. Further, WTOW is seen on the Rockall–Hatton Plateau and in the deep channels connecting with the Iceland Basin, suggesting additional possible WTOW transport pathways. These suggested transport routes remain to be confirmed by further observational or modelling studies.},

The Convention on Biological Diversity, through the Aichi Target 11, has set the ambitious objective of implementing a ‘well connected system of protected areas’ by 2020. 2. This paper identifies eight challenges toward the integration of connectivity into MPA network management and planning. A summary table lists the main recommendations in terms of method, tool, advice, or action to address each of these challenges. Authors belong to a science–management continuum including researchers, international NGO officers, and national MPA agency members. 3. Three knowledge challenges are addressed: selecting and integrating connectivitymeasurementmetrics; assessing the accuracy and uncertainty of connectivitymeasurements; and communicating and visualizing connectivitymeasurements. 4. Three management challenges are described: integrating connectivity into the planning and management of MPA networks; setting quantitative connectivity targets; and implementing connectivity-based management across scales and marine jurisdictions. 5. Finally, two paths toward a better integration of connectivity science withMPAmanagement are proposed: setting management-driven priorities for connectivity research, bridging connectivity science, andMPA networkmanagement. 6. There is no single method to integrate connectivity into marine spatial planning. Rather, an array of methods can be assembled according to the MPA network objectives, budget, available skills, data, and timeframe. 7. Overall, setting up ‘boundary organizations’ should be promoted to organize complex cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdiction interactions that are needed between scientists, managers, stakeholders and decision-makers to make informed decision regarding connectivity-based MPA planning and management.},

abstract = {Cold-water coral reefs form spectacular and highly diverse ecosystems in the deep sea but little is known about reproduction, and virtually nothing about the larval biology in these corals. This study is based on data from two locations of the North East Atlantic and documents the first observations of embryogenesis and larval development in Lophelia pertusa, the most common framework-building cold-water scleractinian. Embryos developed in a more or less organized radial cleavage pattern from ∼ 160 µm large neutral or negatively buoyant eggs, to 120-270 µm long ciliated planulae. Embryogenesis was slow with cleavage occurring at intervals of 6-8 hours up to the 64-cell stage. Genetically characterized larvae were sexually derived, with maternal and paternal alleles present. Larvae were active swimmers (0.5 mm s(-1)) initially residing in the upper part of the water column, with bottom probing behavior starting 3-5 weeks after fertilization. Nematocysts had developed by day 30, coinciding with peak bottom-probing behavior, and possibly an indication that larvae are fully competent to settle at this time. Planulae survived for eight weeks under laboratory conditions, and preliminary results indicate that these planulae are planktotrophic. The late onset of competency and larval longevity suggests a high dispersal potential. Understanding larval biology and behavior is of paramount importance for biophysical modeling of larval dispersal, which forms the basis for predictions of connectivity among populations.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional statistical emulator SNAC (Statistical North-east Atlantic Circulation) for op- erational computation of the oceanic circulation in the north-eastern North Atlantic is presented. SNAC was trained with the output of the numerical three-dimensional ocean model HAMSOM (HAMburg Shelf Ocean Model) and determines the most probable circulation from a prescribed transient weather situation. Air pressure distributions derived from a network of eight weather stations (i.e. airports) provide the forcing. The emulator uses the statistical correlation between air pressure differences amongst selected stations and oceanic currents. Horizontal currents and sea surface elevation are computed on a spherical grid with a resolution of 0.25 (zonal) and 0.125 (meridional). Vertically, the water column is resolved by 11 layers. The emulator domain extends from 44Wto 15.75 E, and from 48.5 to 70 N. SNAC is able to reproduce the temporal variability simulated by numerical models on time scales between 2 months and 1 year, though the program runs up to 500 times faster. Optionally, a simpleM2 tide model can be integrated into the output. As an alternative to a more complex numerical circulation model, SNAC requires far less atmospheric forcing data and much less computational effort. Presently, SNAC provides circulation fields for a tracer model used in simulating the dispersal of fish larvae around Iceland and on the north-west European continental shelf. It might equally well be used to provide boundary values for regional hy- drodynamic ocean models. The program can be downloaded from www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/{\~{}}logemann/ snac/.},

However, the most useful contribution of the genomics model to population genetics will be improving inferences about population demography and evolutionary history.},

abstract = {Most applications of systematic conservation planning have not effectively incorporated biological processes or dynamic threats. We investigated the extent to which connectivity and climate change have been considered in an ecologically meaningful way in marine conservation planning, as an attempt to help formulate conservation objectives for population persistence, over and above representation. Our review of the literature identified 115 marine planning studies that addressed connectivity and 47 that addressed the effects of climate change. Of the statements identified that related to goals and objectives, few were quantitative and justified by ecological evidence for either connectivity (13{\%}) or climate change (8.9{\%}). Most studies addressing connectivity focused on spatial design (e.g. size and spacing) of marine protected areas (MPAs) or clustering of planning units. Climate change recommendations were primarily based on features related to MPA placement (e.g. preferences for areas relatively resilient and resistant to climate change impacts). Quantitative methods to identify spatial or temporal dynamics of features related to connectivity and/or climate change (e.g. functionally well-connected or thermal refugia areas) were rare, and these accounted for the majority of ecologically justified statements. Given these shortcomings in the literature, we outline a framework for setting marine conservation planning objectives that describes six key approaches to more effectively integrate connectivity and climate change into conservation plans, aligning opportunities and minimizing trade-offs between both issues.},

abstract = {Decadal variability is a notable feature of the Atlantic Ocean and the climate of the regions it influences. Prominently, this is manifested in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperatures. Positive (negative) phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian and Sahel rainfall1, European summer precipitation2, Atlantic hurricanes3 and variations in global temperatures4. It is widely believed that ocean circulation drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content5. However, there are no direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient length to support this, leading to questions about whether the AMO is controlled from another source6. Here we provide observational evidence of the widely hypothesized link between ocean circulation and the AMO. We take a new approach, using sea level along the east coast of the United States to estimate ocean circulation on decadal timescales. We show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres—the intergyre region7. These circulation changes affect the decadal evolution of North Atlantic heat content and, consequently, the phases of the AMO. The Atlantic overturning circulation is declining8 and the AMO is moving to a negative phase. This may offer a brief respite from the persistent rise of global temperatures4, but in the coupled system we describe, there are compensating effects. In this case, the negative AMO is associated with a continued acceleration of sea-level rise along the northeast coast of the United States.},

abstract = {The global decline in coral reefs demands urgent management strategies to protect resilience. Protecting ecological connectivity, within and among reefs, and between reefs and other ecosystems is critical to resilience. However, connectivity science is not yet able to clearly identify the specific measures for effective protection of connectivity. This article aims to provide a set of principles or practical guidelines that can be applied currently to protect connectivity. These ‘rules of thumb’ are based on current knowledge and expert opinion, and on the philosophy that, given the urgency, it is better to act with incomplete knowledge than to wait for detailed understanding that may come too late. The principles, many of which are not unique to connectivity, include: (1) allow margins of error in extent and nature of protection, as insurance against unforeseen or incompletely understood threats or critical processes; (2) spread risks among areas; (3) aim for networks of protected areas which are: (a) comprehensive and spread—protect all biotypes, habitats and processes, etc., to capture as many possible connections, known and unknown; (b) adequate—maximise extent of protection for each habitat type, and for the entire region; (c) representative—maximise likelihood of protecting the full range of processes and spatial requirements; (d) replicated—multiple examples of biotypes or processes enhances risk spreading; (4) protect entire biological units where possible (e.g. whole reefs), including buffers around core areas. Otherwise, choose bigger rather than smaller areas; (5) provide for connectivity at a wide range of dispersal distances (within and between patches), emphasising distances <20–30 km; and (6) use a portfolio of approaches, including but not limited to MPAs. Three case studies illustrating the application of these principles to coral reef management in the Bohol Sea (Philippines), the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and Kimbe Bay (Papua New Guinea) are described.},

abstract = {Data on the temporal and spatial variations of 99Tc and 137Cs in UK coastal waters are provided from surveys carried out over the period 1993–1998; prior to and post the discharge of elevated quantities of 99Tc from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield (Cumbria, UK). 99Tc seawater concentrations in the Irish Sea increased by more than an order of magnitude within the study period concomitant with the increase in discharges. 137Cs discharges were relatively low (∼0.3{\%} of their peak values in the 1970s). Simplistically, the 137Cs distribution reflected varying hydrographic conditions superimposed upon the residual concentrations of a system approaching steady state. Differences between the 137Cs/99Tc ratio in Sellafield discharges and seawater indicate that 137Cs remobilisation, from sediments contaminated by large discharges in the 1970s, is presently the predominant (∼90{\%}) source term to the water column. The 137Cs/99Tc ratio in the Irish Sea decreased significantly within the period of these surveys (e.g. reduced from ∼14 in 1993 to 0.4 in 1996, within the vicinity of Sellafield). However, it is difficult to extrapolate this information to assess the contribution from Sellafield in distant waters because the low levels of 137Cs are continuously perturbed by additional inputs during transit (e.g. remobilisation from sediments outside the Irish Sea). Examination of 99Tc data for the North Sea indicates that the leading edge of the first EARP pulse, entering via the Scottish coastal current, may have migrated to the limit of the current flowing south along the British coastal margin within 9 months. The estimated transfer factor (TF) for Sellafield discharges in this current is 52Bqm−3/PBqannum−1 with transit times from Sellafield to the Pentland Firth and Lowestoft of ∼9 and ∼24 months, respectively. These transit times, derived from the 99Tc data, are significantly shorter than previous estimates based on 137Cs and 90Sr data from the 1970s and 1980s.},

The radiocaesium distributions in the Hebridean Sea were monitored during the summers of 1976 and 1977 and these imply major differences in water flow through the region in these two years. In 1976 the coastal movement of Irish Sea-derived water is explained by a flow, from the North Channel, of water having source radionuclide concentrations similar to those observed in the Clyde Sea area. Advective velocities of ∼1·6 and ∼5 km day−1 are implied for northward movement through the North Channel and Hebridean Sea respectively. In 1977, however, a much more extensive ‘coastal plume’ of Irish Sea-derived water could be correlated with increased flushing through the North Channel earlier in the year. Radiocaesium distributions in the Hebridean Sea are consistent with a clockwise water flow around the southern islands of the Outer Hebrides.},

abstract = {Deep sea scleractinian corals will be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, facing loss of up to 70{\%} of their habitat as the Aragonite Saturation Horizon (below which corals are unable to form calcium carbonate skeletons) rises. Persistence of deep sea scleractinian corals will therefore rely on the ability of larvae to disperse to, and colonise, suitable shallow-water habitat. We used DNA sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), the mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (16S) and mitochondrial control region (MtC) to determine levels of gene flow both within and among populations of the deep sea coral Desmophyllum dianthus in SE Australia, New Zealand and Chile to assess the ability of corals to disperse into different regions and habitats. We found significant genetic subdivision among the three widely separated geographic regions consistent with isolation and limited contemporary gene flow. Furthermore, corals from different depth strata (shallow <600 m, mid 1000-1500 m, deep >1500 m) even on the same or nearby seamounts were strongly differentiated, indicating limited vertical larval dispersal. Genetic differentiation with depth is consistent with the stratification of the Subantarctic Mode Water, Antarctic Intermediate Water, the Circumpolar Deep and North Pacific Deep Waters in the Southern Ocean, and we propose that coral larvae will be retained within, and rarely migrate among, these water masses. The apparent absence of vertical larval dispersal suggests deep populations of D. dianthus are unlikely to colonise shallow water as the aragonite saturation horizon rises and deep waters become uninhabitable. Similarly, assumptions that deep populations will act as refuges for shallow populations that are impacted by activities such as fishing or mining are also unlikely to hold true. Clearly future environmental management strategies must consider both regional and depth-related isolation of deep-sea coral populations.},

abstract = {Ecohydrodynamics investigates the hydrodynamic constraints on ecosystems across different temporal and spatial scales. Ecohydrodynamics play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems, however the lack of integrated complex flow models for deep-water ecosystems beyond the coastal zone prevents further synthesis in these settings. We present a hydrodynamic model for one of Earth's most biologically diverse deep-water ecosystems, cold-water coral reefs. The Mingulay Reef Complex (western Scotland) is an inshore seascape of cold-water coral reefs formed by the scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa. We applied single-image edge detection and composite front maps using satellite remote sensing, to detect oceanographic fronts and peaks of chlorophyll a values that likely affect food supply to corals and other suspension-feeding fauna. We also present a high resolution 3D ocean model to incorporate salient aspects of the regional and local oceanography. Model validation using in situ current speed, direction and sea elevation data confirmed the model's realistic representation of spatial and temporal aspects of circulation at the reef complex including a tidally driven current regime, eddies, and downwelling phenomena. This novel combination of 3D hydrodynamic modelling and remote sensing in deep-water ecosystems improves our understanding of the temporal and spatial scales of ecological processes occurring in marine systems. The modelled information has been integrated into a 3D GIS, providing a user interface for visualization and interrogation of results that allows wider ecological application of the model and that can provide valuable input for marine biodiversity and conservation applications.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the degree to which populations are connected through larval dispersal is imperative to effective management, yet little is known about larval dispersal ability or population connectivity in Lophelia pertusa, the dominant framework-forming coral on the continental slope in the North Atlantic Ocean. Using nine microsatellite DNA markers, we assessed the spatial scale and pattern of genetic connectivity across a large portion of the range of L. pertusa in the North Atlantic Ocean. A Bayesian modeling approach found four distinct genetic groupings corresponding to ocean regions: Gulf of Mexico, coastal southeastern U.S., New England Seamounts, and eastern North Atlantic Ocean. An isolation-by-distance pattern was supported across the study area. Estimates of pairwise population differentiation were greatest with the deepest populations, the New England Seamounts (average F (ST) = 0.156). Differentiation was intermediate with the eastern North Atlantic populations (F (ST) = 0.085), and smallest between southeastern U.S. and Gulf of Mexico populations (F (ST) = 0.019), with evidence of admixture off the southeastern Florida peninsula. Connectivity across larger geographic distances within regions suggests that some larvae are broadly dispersed. Heterozygote deficiencies were detected within the majority of localities suggesting deviation from random mating. Gene flow between ocean regions appears restricted, thus, the most effective management scheme for L. pertusa involves regional reserve networks.},

We then incorporate spatially realistic predictions of larval connectivity among reefs of the Bahamas and apply novel reserve design algorithms to create reserve networks for a changing climate. We show that scales of larval dispersal are large enough to connect reefs from desirable thermal stress regimes into a reserve network. Critically, we find that reserve designs differ according to the anticipated scope for phenotypic and genetic adaptation in corals, which remains uncertain. Attempts to provide a complete reserve design that hedged against different evolutionary outcomes achieved limited success, which emphasises the importance of considering the scope for adaptation explicitly. Nonetheless, 15{\%} of reserve locations were selected under all evolutionary scenarios, making them a high priority for early designation. Our approach allows new insights into coral holobiont adaptation to be integrated directly into an adaptive approach to management.},

abstract = {An investigation is made of the circulation and structure of the water masses in the Rockall Trough in spring, combining the results of a recent synoptic survey (May 1998) with those from a high-resolution ocean circulation model. In the near-surface layer, saline flows are carried northwards by a “Shelf Edge Current” around the eastern slopes, possibly with some branching in the northern Trough. Fresher waters from the west inflow between 52 and 53°N and partially mix with these saline flows in the southern Trough, so that waters of intermediate salinity are also swept northwards. In the southern approaches to the Trough, Labrador Sea Water (LSW) also flows strongly in from the west between 52 and 53°N, and while much of this turns south, a proportion penetrates north to join a cyclonic gyre in the Trough extending to 56.5°N. The northwestern limb of this gyre is fed by, and mixes with, more saline waters which result from overflows across the Wyville–Thomson Ridge. Furthermore, salinity and CFC data suggest episodic inflow of LSW into the central Trough. The circulation of the North East Atlantic Deep Water in the Trough follows a cyclonic pattern similar to, and lying below, that of the LSW. The Wyville–Thomson Ridge overflows in the model extend to higher densities than in the survey, are topographically steered southwestward down the Feni Ridge system, and eventually join a deep cyclonic circulation in the North East Atlantic basin. Overall, the model and the observations are in good agreement, particularly in the central Rockall Trough, and this has allowed conclusions to be drawn which are significantly more robust than those which would result from either the survey or the model alone. In particular, we have been able to infer cyclonic circulation pathways for the intermediate and deeper waters in the Rockall Trough for (we believe) the first time. The study has also contributed to an ongoing community effort to assess the realism of, and improve, our current generation of ocean circulation models.},

The increase in metabolic rate with temperature explains substantial among-species variation in life-history traits, population dynamics, and ecosystem processes. Temperature can also cause variability in metabolic rate within species. Here, we compare the effect of temperature on a key component of marine life cycles among a geographically and taxonomically diverse group of marine fish and invertebrates. Although innumerable lab studies document the negative effect of temperature on larval development time, little is known about the generality versus taxon-dependence of this relationship. We present a unified, parameterized model for the temperature dependence of larval development in marine animals. Because the duration of the larval period is known to influence larval dispersal distance and survival, changes in ocean temperature could have a direct and predictable influence on population connectivity, community structure, and regional-to-global scale patterns of biodiversity.},

An overview of the system is presented including shelf specific developments of the physical model, the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO), and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data assimilation scheme. Initial validation is presented of the tides and model SST. The SST skill of the system is significantly improved by the data assimilation scheme. Finally, an analysis of the seasonal tidal mixing fronts shows that these, in general, agree well with observation, but data assimilation does not significantly alter their positions.},

abstract = {[ 1] An ensemble-hindcast approach is designed to simulate North Atlantic circulation changes during the period 1948 - 2005 using the Max Plank Institute Ocean Model forced by atmospheric reanalysis data. The experiment seeks to isolate oceanic changes related to the atmospheric forcing history by evaluating the role of initial conditions and masking internal model variability in the ensemble mean results. Characteristics of the complete North Atlantic - Arctic Mediterranean exchange system is described at key sections by time series of exchanges of volume, ice, heat, and liquid freshwater. Volume transports are divided into water masses by properties, and the constructed climatology of exchanges is shown to compare well with available observational estimates of individual branches. In response to the atmospheric forcing history, we find a modest but robust decline of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation of 0.4 Sv/decade, in total 2 - 2.5 Sv since 1948. In contrast, overturning exchanges with the North Atlantic and Nordic Seas and with the Nordic Seas and Arctic Ocean show no sign of cessation. A marked increase in the freshwater storage of the Nordic Seas and in particular of the subpolar Atlantic accompany the model decline in Atlantic overturning. The characteristics of the modeled freshening bears similarities with observed patterns of change since the 1950s, but whereas the origin of observed freshening is uncertain, freshening in the model predominantly results from dynamic changes linked to prominent changes in atmospheric circulation. Moreover, documented increase in the drainage of major Arctic-rivers is found to have a negligible effect on the oceanic changes.},

abstract = {We studied the spatial connectedness of Natura 2000 site boundaries and the functional connectivity of the Natura 2000 network across the 34 terrestrial borders of the European Union. Connectivity was measured by the dispersal success of 192 reptile, amphibian, invertebrate and plant species from Annex II of the European Union Habitats Directive, based on the presence of same species on both sides of the borders. Connectedness and connectivity varied greatly between state borders, with good and bad examples found in all parts of the European Union. Connectedness and connectivity were positively correlated. However, a few outlying examples showed that good connectedness is not necessarily associated with good connectivity and that good connectivity is not always possible because of different habitats and/or different management on both sides of border. In 13 out of 34 borders the connectivity measure was 100{\%} and in 11 other borders it was over 50{\%}. Very few of the geographical and political factors tested to explain variation in connectedness and connectivity were significant. Better connectedness and connectivity, both at the border and site-pair level, was correlated with the rivers forming the border. The time since the designation of the second site in a site-pair was nearly significant, suggesting that connectivity might have always existed in nature but the 'documentation of it' required some time for additional site inventories. It seems that each country border has its own history with a unique subset of factors influencing Natura 2000 site selection and management thus generalising our findings to other international borders would be difficult. We did not find substantial differences in trans-boundary connectivity among taxonomic groups. The application of our method elsewhere in the World would perhaps bring interesting results at a large (continental or sub-continental) scale, provided that similar data are available. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We derive measures for assessing the value of an individual habitat fragment for the dynamics and persistence of a metapopulation living in a network of many fragments. We demonstrate that the most appropriate measure of fragment value depends on the question asked. Specifically, we analyse four alternative measures: the contribution of a fragment to the metapopulation capacity of the network, to the equilibrium metapopulation size, to the expected time to metapopulation extinction and the long-term contribution of a fragment to colonization events in the network. The latter measure is comparable to density-dependent measures in general matrix population theory, though some differences are introduced by the fact that “density dependence” is spatially localized in the metapopulation context. We show that the value of a fragment depends not only on the properties of the landscape but also on the properties of the species. Most importantly, variation in fragment values between the habitat fragments is greatest in the case of rare species that occur close to the extinction threshold, as these species are likely to be restricted to the most favorable parts of the landscape. We expect that the measures of habitat fragment value described and analysed here have applications in landscape ecology and in conservation biology.},

abstract = {Pelagic organisms' movement and motion of buoyant particles are driven by processes operating across multiple, spatial and temporal scales. We developed a probabilistic, multi-scale model, the Connectivity Modeling System (CMS), to gain a mechanistic understanding of dispersion and migration processes in the ocean. The model couples offline a new nested-grid technique to a stochastic Lagrangian framework where individual variability is introduced by drawing particles' attributes at random from specified probability distributions of traits. This allows 1) to track seamlessly a large number of both actively swimming and inertial particles over multiple, independent ocean model domains and 2) to generate ensemble forecasts or hindcasts of the particles' three dimensional trajectories, dispersal kernels, and transition probability matrices used for connectivity estimates. In addition, CMS provides Lagrangian descriptions of oceanic phenomena (advection, dispersion, retention) and can be used in a broad range of oceanographic applications, from the fate of pollutants to the pathways of water masses in the global ocean. Here we describe the CMS modular system where particle behavior can be augmented with specific features, and a parallel module implementation simplifies data management and CPU intensive computations associated with solving for the tracking of millions of active particles. Some novel features include on-the-fly data access of operational hydrodynamic models, individual particle variability and inertial motion, and multi-nesting capabilities to optimize resolution. We demonstrate the performance of the interpolation algorithm by testing accuracy in tracing the flow stream lines in both time and space and the efficacy of probabilistic modeling in evaluating the bio-physical coupling against empirical data. Finally, following recommended practices for the development of community models, we provide an open source code with a series of coupled standalone, optional modules detailed in a user's guide.},

abstract = {A high resolution nested model of the Western Iberia shelf is developed and compared with field observations. We use an embedded particle tracking submodel that includes advection, diffusion, and diel vertical migration to simulate crab larvae dispersal. A set of experiments with varying oceanographic conditions and Lagrangian model parameters is analysed. It is found that major dispersal patterns that were observed in nature are reproduced in the model. The floats drift within meridionally elongated patches parallel to the coast usually inshore of the 100 m isobath. This distribution is controlled by local wind-driven circulation, buoyancy input from adjacent rivers, local topography, and vertical diel movements. River plumes are critical factors for retention patterns as they influence the near surface stratification, surface Ekman layer and innershelf processes. Weakly stratified coastal waters associated with low river run-off generate an enlarged innershelf whose dynamics tend to trap the floats and force them to drift along-wind. We find that the response to downwelling-favourable winds is always more dramatic than upwelling-favourable ones and this asymmetry results in a net Lagrangian transport directed poleward. Analyses of float distributions show that a large part of the floats (∼50{\%}) is actually retained in the shelf zone near the emission points. A dispersal distance (Ld) of about 60 km is estimated which is mostly representative of along-shore dispersion. Some consequences of our results to local population dynamics are finally discussed.},

abstract = {Eight years of current data, 5.5 years of Eulerian current meter data and 2 years of Lagrangian data, are analysed in the context of seasonality along the continental slope margin of NW Europe, across shelfbreak flow and continental shelf flow. Long-term records from the continental slope at the ∼1000m depth contour on Goban Spur and Little Sole Bank Spur show maximum recorded currents in the range 39–43cms-1, but typical maximum monthly mean values are ∼10cms-1 in the upper half of the water column. On the slope, the flow is predominantly poleward in the general alongslope direction with maximum flow in winter (December–January). The spur situation can result in four preferred directions of alongslope flow which due to topographic control is less evident near the sea floor (∼50m up), where the flow is predominantly poleward. Equatorward upper layer flow tends to occur in the spring (March–April) period but can extend to the sea floor and into the summer period nearer the sea surface. Some seasonal signatures correlate with sea level anomalies seen in altimeter data in the continental slope and shelf region. May infrared remote sensing images show cool water separating from the upper slope (∼1km water depth contour) region of Goban Spur both in a WNW and SSW direction (i.e. the off-slope preferred flow directions) reflecting both poleward and equatorward flows. The seasonal results are discussed in terms of the SOMA (September–October/March–April) seasonal response. The long-term or near annual Eulerian residual mean flows were typically 2cms-1 throughout the water column and poleward in the alongslope direction. The upper layer (30m depth) shelf currents, ∼30km onshelf from the Goban Spur shelfbreak, were markedly onshelf with a Eulerian mean of 6cms-1 over a 129-day period. A carefully prepared drogued Argos buoy (drogued at 45m depth), and deliberately placed for subsequent along continental shelf margin movement, released a further 100km onshelf, moved northward and parallel to the western Celtic shelfbreak towards the south of Ireland. Here the drogued buoy found the Valentia Coastal Current, passed west of Ireland on the mid-shelf, then along the continental shelfbreak (200m contour) and through the LOIS SES site, reaching a maximum speed of 66cms-1 (12h average). The drogued buoy entered the Northern North Sea, north of the Shetland Isles, travelling a distance of ∼1600km over a period of 5 months. Drogued buoys were deployed in the ocean and on the shelf. Overall, it is shown that the continental slope is an insulator for ocean shelf exchange but the ocean margin is a conductor for advective influences from the south.},

abstract = {Possible changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) provide a key source of uncertainty regarding future climate change. Maps of temperature trends over the twentieth century show a conspicuous region of cooling in the northern Atlantic. Here we present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that this cooling may be due to a reduction in the AMOC over the twentieth century and particularly after 1970. Since 1990 the AMOC seems to have partly recovered. This time evolution is consistently suggested by an AMOC index based on sea surface temperatures, by the hemispheric temperature difference, by coral-based proxies and by oceanic measurements. We discuss a possible contribution of the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet to the slowdown. Using a multi-proxy temperature reconstruction for the AMOC index suggests that the AMOC weakness after 1975 is an unprecedented event in the past millennium (p > 0.99). Further melting of Greenland in the coming decades could contribute to further weakening of the AMOC.},

abstract = {Deep-sea corals were discovered over a century ago, but it is only over recent years that focused efforts have been made to explore the history of the oceans using the geochemistry of their skeletal remains. They offer a promising archive of past oceanic environments given their global distribution, layered growth patterns, longevity and preservation as well as our ability to date them using radiometric techniques. This paper provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in terms of geochemical approaches to using deep-sea coral skeletons to explore the history of the ocean. Deep-sea coral skeletons have a wide array of morphologies (e.g. solitary cup corals, branching colonial corals) and materials (calcite, aragonite and proteins). As such their biomineralization strategies are diverse, leading to complex geochemistry within coral skeletons. Notwithstanding these complications, progress has been made on developing methods for reconstructing the oceanographic environment in the past using trace elements and isotopic methods. Promising approaches within certain coral groups include clumped isotopes and Mg/Li for temperature reconstructions, boron isotopes and radiocarbon for carbon cycling, $\epsilon$Nd, and radiocarbon for circulation studies and $\delta$15N, P/Ca and Ba/Ca for nutrient tracer studies. Likewise there is now a range of techniques for dating deep-sea corals skeletons (e.g. U-series, radiocarbon), and determining their growth rates (e.g. radiocarbon and 210Pb). Dating studies on historic coral populations in the Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Pacific point to climate and environmental changes being dominant controls on coral populations over millennial and orbital timescales. This paper provides a review of a range of successes and promising approaches. It also highlights areas in which further research would likely provide new insights into biomineralization, palaeoceanography and distribution of past coral populations.},

On the effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation on temperature and salinity of the subpolar North Atlantic intermediate and deep waters. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1448-1454. The close relationship between the observed water mass properties and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (1950-2000s; r2 {\{}approx{\}} 0.65) implies that changes in the NAO-related atmospheric forcing may account for up to two-thirds of thermohaline changes at the intermediate and deep levels in the subpolar North Atlantic on a decadal time-scale. Persistent NAO decline (amplification) results in increase (decrease) in temperature and salinity in the intermediate-deep water column. A general mechanism explaining the close link between the NAO and coherent decadal changes in the intermediate and deep-water temperature and salinity in the region is inferred from the observed changes in the regional circulation and water mass properties. Two factors dominate this link: (i) intensity of convection in the Labrador Sea controlling injection of relatively cold freshwater into the intermediate layer, and (ii) zonal extension of the Subpolar Gyre that regulates the relative contribution of cold fresh subpolar water and warm saline subtropical water to the deep-water formation.},

abstract = {The mesoscale dynamics of the Scottish side of the Faroe–Shetland Channel have been investigated using synoptic in situ and remote sensing observations. A cold core cyclonic eddy, identified from an AVHRR image, had a diameter of about 50km and surface current speeds of up to 50cms-1; it appeared to be attached to the 800m isobath as it moved north-eastward along the edge of the channel at about 8cms-1. Speeds in the slope current were about 50cms-1 but increased to 70cms-1 where the current was compressed by the eddy. Offshore, over the 1000m isobath in the cooler water, speeds in the current were slower (ca. 20cms-1). North-west of the Shetlands the offshore edge of the slope current was deflected across the channel for a distance of about 70km from the shelf edge. The speed of drifters in the slope current increased to over 60cms-1 as they moved anti-cyclonically around this deflection. CTD profiles suggest that the movement of the surface waters was mirrored in the deep water of the channel. The deflection carried a very large quantity of North Atlantic Water into the central part of the channel; its cause and ultimate fate are not known, although it is likely to have had a significant impact on the dynamics of the channel.},

abstract = {Recent observations from the Argo dataset of temperature and salinity profiles are used to evaluate a
series of 3-year data assimilation experiments in a global ice–ocean general circulation model. The experiments are
designed to evaluate a new data assimilation system whereby salinity is assimilated along isotherms, S(T ). In addition,
the role of a balancing salinity increment to maintain water mass properties is investigated. This balancing increment is
found to effectively prevent spurious mixing in tropical regions induced by univariate temperature assimilation, allowing
the correction of isotherm geometries without adversely influencing temperature–salinity relationships. In addition, the
balancing increment is able to correct a fresh bias associated with a weak subtropical gyre in the North Atlantic using only
temperature observations. The S(T ) assimilation method is found to provide an important improvement over conventional
depth level assimilation, with lower root-mean-squared forecast errors over the upper 500 m in the tropical Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans. An additional set of experiments is performed whereby Argo data are withheld and used for independent
evaluation. The most significant improvements from Argo assimilation are found in less well-observed regions (Indian,
South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans). When Argo salinity data are assimilated in addition to temperature, improvements
to modelled temperature fields are obtained due to corrections to model density gradients and the resulting circulation. It is
found that observations from the Argo array provide an invaluable tool for both correcting modelled water mass properties
through data assimilation and for evaluating the assimilation methods themselves.},

abstract = {The intensity, structure and variability of the slope current have been determined from 16 months of observations with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and conventional current meters on a cross-slope section at the Hebridean shelf edge during the Shelf Edge Study (SES) programme. After removal of the tidal signals, the mean flow over the upper slope is found to be closely parallel to the topography with speeds of . 20 cmEs.1. The flow extends down to a depth of 500 m and is predominantly barotropic, especially in winter when the flow is practically uniform between 350 m and the surface. In summer, there is a significant baroclinic component with a pronounced maximum in current at a depth of about 200 m but more than 80{\%} of the kinetic energy is in the barotropic component. Flow in the core of the current is highly persistent with the Neumannfs steadiness St 0.8 in summer. In winter the flow is generally more energetic and variable and extends onto the adjacent shelf. The cross-slope profile of sea surface elevation, computed from the mean barotropic currents, shows a consistent relation to seabed topography through the seasonal cycle. Long-term averages of the cross-slope components are generally small (. 2 cmEs.1) with some indication of persistent down-slope flow in the bottom Ekman layer. Measurements with shipboard ADCP on sections at intervals along the slope show a high degree of continuity in the structure of the flow. The core of the flow appears to be related to a weak positive salinity anomaly and a depression of the 9.5 ‹C isotherm near the shelf, but there is no strong correlation between the core of the slope-current and the core of the salinity anomaly. It is proposed that this may be due to differences in the cross-stream diffusion of salt and momentum which have different boundary conditions at the slope...},

abstract = {The process of coral larval dispersal is important for coral reef ecosystems, but remains poorly understood and hard to gauge. Better knowledge of inter-reef connectivity patterns would be useful in enabling better management of coral reef waters however. By employing a spatially explicit numerical modelling approach, we simulate larval dispersal through the central section of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), comprising over 1000 reefs, and identify spatial patterns in the inter-reef connectivity network using a community detection method from network science. This paper presents the modelling approach used and discusses the significance of the results. Inter-reef connectivity networks were estimated for 4 different coral species, and significant differences between them were found. We show how we can partition reefs into clusters, or “communities”, that are sparsely connected with each other, and therefore identify important barriers to larval dispersal. By fine-tuning a resolution parameter in the community detection method, we can find dispersal barriers of varying strength. Finally, we show that the average connectivity length scale varies significantly across the different reef communities, and suggest that this may have repercussions for the optimal placement of marine protected areas (MPAs) to maximise connectivity with surrounding reefs.},

We study the effects of using the different datasets on the temperature fields and the circulation. On the continental shelf, comparisons of POLCOMS output with AVHRR sea surface temperature data suggest that the effect of using different ocean model initial and boundary conditions is small and that, after 15 months of model time, the impact of the different initial conditions is negligible. Stronger evidence of influence is seen in the deeper oceanic regions of the domain. Volume fluxes through sections governing flow into and out of the North Sea, through the Irish Sea and along the shelf edge show that the impact of the different boundary conditions is small on the shelf but significant elsewhere. These results are contrasted with the use of climatology to assess the value of these Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) ocean model products.},

abstract = {The precarious state of many nearshore marine ecosystems has prompted the use of marine protected areas as a tool for management and conservation. However, there remains substantial debate over their design and, in particular, how to best account for the spatial dynamics of nearshore marine species. Many commercially important nearshore marine species are sedentary as adults, with limited home ranges. It is as larvae that they disperse greater distances, traveling with ocean currents sometimes hundreds of kilometers. As a result, these species exist in spatially complex systems of connected subpopulations. Here, we explicitly account for the mutual dependence of subpopulations and approach protected area design in terms of network robustness. Our goal is to characterize the topology of nearshore metapopulation networks and their response to perturbation, and to identify critical subpopulations whose protection would reduce the risk for stock collapse. We define metapopulation networks using realistic estimates of larval dispersal generated from ocean circulation simulations and spatially explicit metapopulation models, and we then explore their robustness using node-removal simulation experiments. Nearshore metapopulations show small-world network properties, and we identify a set of highly connected hub subpopulations whose removal maximally disrupts the metapopulation network. Protecting these subpopulations reduces the risk for systemic failure and stock collapse. Our focus on catastrophe avoidance provides a unique perspective for spatial marine planning and the design of marine protected areas.},

abstract = {Aim We develop the first global model of connectivity for a generic broadcast spawning coral, and compare the results to connectivity estimates from genetic studies, general biogeographic patterns and theories. We also derive various ‘connectivity indices’ describing relative isolation and source potential between locations. Location Modelled oceans 47° S–47° N. Methods Dispersal of model coral ‘larvae’ was simulated over 8 years using an individual-based biophysical dispersal model driven by 1/12°-resolution surface ocean current data and incorporating individual trait variability (e.g. a phased pre-competency period).Source and arrival locations of modelled larvae onsuitable reef habitat gave standardized dispersal paths and relative levels of connectivity. Results In the model c. 50{\%} of connections occurred within 50–100 km, with rarer dispersal between regions linking entire oceans in a ‘stepping stone’ fashion. The central Pacific was an almost complete barrier to dispersal, only rarely breachedwestward fromthe Galapagos to Marquesas Islands.Areas showing strong isolation also included Hawaii, Easter Island, the Red Sea and the eastern Atlantic. The Indo-West Pacific and Great Barrier Reef showed the highest levels of connec- tivity,with secondary peaks in the western Indian Ocean, corresponding to areas of enriched coral diversity. The central Indo-Pacific diversity hotspot was overall a greater source than sink for dispersal. Conclusions This study provides a global view of connectivity that complements genetic and biogeographic work as well as providing a number of novel findings relevant to biogeographic theories (e.g. the central Indo-Pacific as a dispersal source; Johnston Atoll as the sole ‘stepping-stone’ intoHawaii). Discrepancies with proposed connectivity patterns (e.g. one-way, westward, connectivity across the central Pacific) present hypotheses for future research. The model represents an effective tool for exploring the factors controlling connectivity on this scale and the effects of climate change on future connectivity, and will also aid predictions of future reef distributions.
